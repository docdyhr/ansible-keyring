1) get community.general.keyring to work
problem:
TASK [test of keyring plugin] fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"msg": "Can't LOOKUP(keyring): missing required python library 'keyring'"}

Possible solutions:
 python path
 executable bit ie chmod +x
 cp python file to project folder
 python3 and sudo python3 uses different paths / versions of Pyhton3
