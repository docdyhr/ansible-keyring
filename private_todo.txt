1) get community.general.keyring to work

problem:
TASK [test of keyring plugin] fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"msg": "Can't LOOKUP(keyring): missing required python library 'keyring'"}

Possible solutions:
 python path / different versions of python installed on localhost combined with sudo
 
 See issue [#1](https://github.com/docdyhr/ansible-keyring/issues/1)
 
 executable bit ie chmod +x  NO ( not nescesary in this context as community.general.keyring is an ansible plugin )
 cp python file to project folder No ( tested in another context and it did not matter! )
 python path
 executable bit ie chmod +x
 cp python file to project folder
 python3 and sudo python3 uses different paths / versions of Pyhton3
